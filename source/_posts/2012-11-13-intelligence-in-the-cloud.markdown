Dr. Suzanne Yoakum-Stover is Executive Director of the Institute for Modern Intelligence. It is very hard to categorize this physics PhD turned data modeler. Or is it data scientist? Ontologist? Engineer? Dr. Suzi hasn't come up with a title herself beyond her small institute and consulting business. But she surely doesn't talk like the CIOs and architects we're used to. She was tapped to bring ultra large-scale intelligence data to a private cloud computing environment and the use of columnar databases in lab work now used by the government. At the moment, most of her work is for the US Army, but it's not her ultimate goal to work in government intelligence. Her driving ambition is an ultra-large, Internet scale abstract model for capturing data from any source in any data model without loss or distortion. With her research partner, she's come up with a framework she'd like to share openly as a kind of Fermi Lab for scholars and scientists to pursue research.
